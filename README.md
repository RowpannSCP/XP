# XPSystem, fork of BruteForceMaestro/XPSystem
 A not so basic, customisable leveling system for SCP: SL.
Features include:
- Badges based on level
- Level in nickname
- Lots of ways to earn xp
- Customizable messages for leveling
- Some other stuff I cannot be bothered to write

You can always request more features by messaging me on discord: `moddedmcplayer`

## Notes
- Due to limitations with subkeys and my lack of willingness to make a complex system to handle this,
XPECLimitedDicts cooldown will be combined when the default item is used,
even if LimitUnified is disabled.
You can work around this by providing overrides for every possible subkey,
even if their value is the same as the default.
- Any config that wants you to specify a type name **NEEDS** to be a assembly qualified name if it is **NOT BUILT-IN**
